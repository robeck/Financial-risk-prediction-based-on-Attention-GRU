## Global financial crisis; Systemic Financial Risk;
The global economic crisis has had a huge impact on economies and people's lives. From the Asian financial crisis in 1997 to the new coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and the global downturn in 2022, it is obvious that the triggering factors and transmission processes of economic and financial crises have become more and more complex;

+ From the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008 to the UBS debt crisis in 2022, we have observed that there have been far too many financial crises and systemic risks as a result of financial institution failure. While many experts, research institutions, and even BCBS, which specializes in global banking also security oversight, have made recommendations and regulation on financial security. However, in the current complex financial environment, systemic risk is still difficult to prevent;

+ In recent years, some systemic risk measures have been proposed to identify systemically important financial institutions, such as the vulnerability index (VI) (zhou, 2010), systemic risk index (SRISK) (Acharya et al., 2012), component expected shortfall (CES) (Banulescu & Durnitrescu, 2015), marginal expected shortfall (MES)â€¦ However, these systemic risk measures focus only on the systemic risk contribution of a financial institution to the financial system and ignore the interdependence between financial institutions.

## Financial Network perspective
As economic globalization advances, supply, industrial and value chains form multidimensional and complex linkages between countries, which at the same time advances the globalization of financial market connectivity (e.g. cross-border listings and debt issuance). 

+ The network is a collection of nodes and edges, and the connection between nodes are weighted according to the correlation. The weight are varying over times, which display the time-varying characteristics on networks. It has been evidenced that financial system are highly interdependent ( Acemoglu et al., 2015; Cohen et al., 2014).

+ There are also an increasing number of application scenarios for the network, including common risk management, portfolio optimization, supply chain optimization, etc. There is no denying that the natural structure of networks can often have unexpected effects in scientific research.

## Financial risk detection and prediction
financial risk early warning system (EWS) and Financial early warning (FEW) models aim to help companies recognize possible financial crises and reduce financial risks through generating FEW messages. The financial crises which occurred frequently needed related financial early warning models to recognize possible crises and therefore reduce financial risks. A main component of building a financial risk prediction system is to build financial risk prediction models (Davis & Karim, 2008)

+ EWSs are used for detecting financial performance, financial risk and potential bankruptcies. EWSs give a chance to management to take advantage of opportunities to avoid or mitigate potential problems. Nearly, all of the financial EWSs are based on financial statements. Balance sheets and income tables are the data sources that reflect the financial truth for early warning systems.

+ FEW, Early warning models for financial risk can be broadly divided into traditional and modern approaches. Firstly, the two statistical models (logit model and multivariate discriminant analysis) are still very popular (particularly for industrial use) because they are well-known models for FEW predictions and are easy to model, interpret, and explain (Arjana and Igor. 2012; Davis and Karim.2008;Eric. 2012). Besides, the machine learning models are also used in current research (Yang et al. 2001; Yu et al. 2010; Yang and Wang. 2019)
